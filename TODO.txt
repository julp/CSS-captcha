* play with CSS3 selector ? (first, last, nth)
* placement, right to left, left to right (float) ?
    => experimental in plain php
* [done?] insert random \s before and after ?
* [done?] don't generate class from first character to last one: shuffle them ?
* play with position and/or overflow ?
* [done?] insert fake hidden element (display: none) ? + allow user to set CSS code (not necessary display: none ; allow to play on colors?)
* [done?] remove confusables ?
  - lower L
  - upper I
  - upper O
* [done?] remove code points newer than Unicode 5.0.0 ? (see unicode/uchar.h, function u_charAge and unicode/uversion.h, function u_versionFromString, then memcmp both)
    => implemented, everyone can generate its own tables
* generate a random id instead of <div id="captcha"> ? (without digits)

CSS obfuscation:
* synonyms for nth-child ? 1/X = first-child, X/X = last-child, ...
* mathematical expressions for nth-child ? (5 => 3 + 2 ?) => only prefix "0n+" is "valid"
* random comments (/* ... */)
